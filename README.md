# "Strat"-Style Partscaster Guitar
This repository is intended to document the at-home build of a DIY guitar, a project completed over a few weeks in 2022.

## Parts Sources
### Body
The guitar's body was purchased unfinished from [Warmoth Custom Guitar & Bass Parts](https://warmoth.com), a licensed manufacturer of Fender brand guitar necks and bodies located in Puyallup, WA. It was chosen specifically for its low cost; namely, it was the cheapest in-stock option at the time.
### Neck
The guitar's neck, also unfinished, was sourced from [Musikraft](https://musikraft.com) in Vineland, New Jersey. Upgrades I couldn't live without were jumbo stainless steel frets and a 24.75-inch "short" scale length.
### Electronics
The pickups were the cheapest I could find that would still deliver satisfactory performance; I chose noiseless [GFS](https://www.guitarfetish.com) alnico single-coil type in the neck and middle positions, and an [Artec](http://artecsound.com) rails-style humbucker for the lead/bridge position. Capacitors, resistors, potentiometers and wire were all items I already had on hand.
